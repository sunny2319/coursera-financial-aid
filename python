I’m a student from India and want to learn Python. I think it will be beneficial for my thesis work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course.  In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs.  So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.
I want to take this course as I want to learn.

I want to complete this python course because to survive in todays corporate sector u need this. This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out my carrier and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.
I plan to complete all assignments on or before time . Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
